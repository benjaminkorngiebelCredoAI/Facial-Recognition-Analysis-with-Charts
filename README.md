# Facial-Recognition-Analysis-with-Charts
Jupyter Notebook that provides metrics for Rekognition based on a sample from FairFace dataset- 20 images each of males and females for all racial subgroups (Indian, Middle Eastern, East Asian, Southeast Asian, White and Black). The metrics include precision, recall, false discovery rate, false positive rate, and false negative rate, with confidence intervals for each. The resulting data is then presented visually in a few different charts. The FairFace dataset is not included in this repository.
